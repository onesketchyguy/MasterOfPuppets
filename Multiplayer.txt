Multiplayer may be something we would have to push to a post launch update.

Players possession rules are the same as the single player rules.

Modes:

Team elimations
	NPC's are still spawned as normal.
	One player/team plays demons
	Other player/team plays people.

Free for all:
	NPC's are still spawned as normal.
	All players play a human until death then they switch to playing a demon
	after death. One player wins after 'x' minutes with a certain score.

MDK:
	Co-op run with your friend and murder the town as demons
